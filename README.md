Toy program to automatically parse a research paper pdf and test the models against data.

Eventually I feel this will come of age, but I think it would be interesting if you could demonstrate it on special cases. 
How much of this process can we automate?

This program will (eventually) download a pdf, look for testable equations/models, metaprogram a test script, automatically download relevant data, and try a fit.
